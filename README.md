# CodeAcademy C Course Tasks

An especially important part of any Code Academy course is the homework, which
is designed to give you plenty of the practice you **need** to become an actual
programmer. Most tasks consist of just a textual description of what you should
implement but occasionally you will also be given code to interact with.

These unusual tasks are what this repository contains.
